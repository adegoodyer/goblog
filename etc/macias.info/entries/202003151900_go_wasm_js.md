Go and WebAssembly (I): interacting with your browser JS API
=====================================================

Golang provides the `syscall/js` experimental package to facilitate
the creation of browser-based applications without requiring any javascript
transpiler; just targeting your official Go compiler to WebAssembly and loading
the artifact in the browser. This blog post is a simple tutorial to allow you
setting up your Go WebAssembly project, as well as some basic functions to
allow your Go code interacting with JavaScript objects and functions.

## Environment setup

Your Go WebAssembly project requires three files:

* A `.wasm` file, containing the WebAssembly binary data. This file is generated
  by the `go` command after building your project.
* The `wasm_exec.js` file. It's a JavaScript file provided by Go to load your
  `.wasm` file into a Web page.
* An HTML file that loads the `wasm_exec.js` JavaScript and invokes it to fetch
  and execute the `.wasm` code into your browse.

You will also need a web server to load the above files via HTTP(S),
as the WebAssembly file can't be loaded directly from disk. This tutorial
uses dummy Go server code, to avoid installing any server locally.

### Create our project

We'll create a simple, Go project, and we will puth the `html`, `js` and `wasm`
files in a directory named `site`

Linux/Mac command-line instructions:

```
$ mkdir go-wasm-tutorial
$ go mod init github.com/mariomac/go-wasm-tutorial
$ cd site/
```

(Replace `github.com/mariomac/go-wasm-tutorial` by your own module name).

### Download `wasm_exec.js`

The `wasm_exec.js` file is available in your standard Go installation. Just copy
it into the `site` folder with the following command:

```
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" ./site/
```

### Create your HTML file

For example, let's create an `index.html` file under the `site` folder:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8"/>
  <script src="wasm_exec.js"></script>
  <script>
    const go = new Go();
    WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("main.wasm"), go.importObject)
        .then((result) => {
          go.run(result.instance);
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

The file is empty. It just loads the `wasm_exec.js` and fetches the `main.wasm`
file that is created in the following section.

### Compile your code into `main.wasm`

Let's create a dummy Go program in the `./main-wasm/main.go` path of
your project:

```go
package main

import "log"

func main() {
    log.Println("Hello Gophers!")
}
```

And let's compile it into the `./site/main.wasm` binary file:

```
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ./site/main.wasm ./wasm-main/.
```

Please observe that you need to set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment
variables to `js` and `wasm`, respectively.

### Execute your Go WebAssembly program

You will need a Web server to allow fetching all the information. Modern IDEs
like IntelliJ IDEA bring their own bundled server, so you can preview your local
files as if they were in a remote server.

If you are using a plain text editor and don't want to install any web server,
the following `server.go` file in your project root will do the job:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)
// super-simple debug server to test our Go WASM files
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        if req.RequestURI == "/" {
            req.RequestURI = "/index.html"
        }
        file, err := os.Open(filepath.Join("./site", req.RequestURI))
        if err == nil {
            io.Copy(w, file)
        }
    })
    fmt.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

When you run the server (e.g. `go run server.go`) and go to
`http://localhost:8080` in your browser, you should see an empty screen. But if
you open the _Console_ in the _developer tools_ section of your browser,
you should see that the `log` command in the `./main-wasm/main.go` has been
executed:

To allow Go interacting with a Web Page and read/write contents in the actual
HTML document, let's see some methods of the `syscall/js` library.

## `syscall/js` basic functionalities

Let's walk through the basic functionalities of `syscall/js` with a simple
example:

```go
 1: func main() {
 2: 	window := js.Global()
 3: 	doc := window.Get("document")
 4:	body := doc.Get("body")
 5:	div := doc.Call("createElement", "div")
 6:	div.Set("textContent", "hello!!")
 7:	body.Call("appendChild", div)
 8:	body.Set("onclick",
 9:		js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
10:			div := doc.Call("createElement", "div")
11:			div.Set("textContent", "click!!")
12:			body.Call("appendChild", div)
13:			return nil
14:		}))
15:	<-make(chan struct{})
16: }
```

This code adds to the HTML document a `<div>` element containing the `Hello!!`
message. In addition, the program is subscribed to the `onclick` event of the
document, and each time the user clicks the document, a new `<div>` is added,
containing the `click!!` text.

The functions used in this example are:

`js.Global()` in Line 1 returns the global object, usually the equivalent
to the JavaScript `window` object: the _root_ object that will allow you accessing
all the other elements in your page.

`js.Global()` returns a `js.Value`: a struct that can store any JavaScript type.
You will get used to work with `js.Value`, as it's what most functions and
properties return.

The `Get` method invoked on a `js.Value` returns another `js.Value`
belonging to the property passed as argument. For example, the `Get` invocations
in lines 3, and 4. 

The opposite of `Get` is the `Set` function, which receives two arguments: the
name of a property, and its new value. The value doesn't
need to be a `js.Value` instance: you can pass numbers or strings, like in
lines 6 and 11, and even instances of `js.Func` (lines 8-9), that specify
a function to be assigned to this property. In the example of lines 8-9,
a given Go function is assigned to the `onclick` event.

Finally, the example code also uses the `Call` method of `js.Value` to invoke
methods of a given type. `Call` requires the name of a function as the first
argument, following by a variable number of arguments. Examples of `Call` are
seen in lines 5, 7, 10 an 12. As for `Set`, the arguments can be native Go types
or other `js.Value` or `js.Func`.

The simplest way to instantiate a `js.Func` is by means of the `js.FuncOf` Go
auxiliary function.

## To know more

This introduction tutorial does not cover many other functionalities, as
instantiating JavaScript objects. For more details, please check the
[`syscall/js` package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/).
