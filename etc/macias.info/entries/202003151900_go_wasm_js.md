Go and WebAssembly (I): interacting with your browser JS API
=====================================================

The Go language provides the `syscall/js` experimental package, which facilitates
the creation of Frontend applications with Go without requiring any javascript
transpiler; just targeting your official Go compiler to WebAssembly and loading
it into your browser. This blog post is a simple tutorial to allow you setting
up your Go WebAssembly development project, as well as some basic patterns to
allow your code interacting with JavaScript objects and functions.

## Environment setup

Your Go WebAssembly will require three files:

* A `.wasm` file, containing the WebAssembly binary data. This file is generated
  by the `go` command after building your project.
* The `wasm_exec.js` file. It's a JavaScript file provided by Go to load your
  `.wasm` file into a WebPage.
* An HTML file that loads the `wasm_exec.js` JavaScript and invokes it to fetch
  and execute the `.wasm` code into your browse.

You will also need a web server that allows loading the three files via HTTP(S),
as the WebAssembly file can't be loaded locally. In this tutorial, we will use
a simple Go program, to avoid installing any server locally.

### Create our project

We'll create a simple, Go project, and we will puth the `html`, `js` and `wasm`
files in a directory named `site`

Linux/Mac command-line instructions:

```
$ mkdir go-wasm-tutorial
$ go mod init github.com/mariomac/go-wasm-tutorial
$ cd site/
```

(Replace `github.com/mariomac/go-wasm-tutorial` by your own module name).

### Download `wasm_exec.js`

The `wasm_exec.js` file is available in your standard Go installation. Just copy
it into the `site` folder with the following command:

```
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" ./site/
```

### Create your HTML file

For example, let's create an `index.html` file under the `site` folder:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <script src="wasm_exec.js"></script>
    <script>
        const go = new Go();
        WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("main.wasm"), go.importObject)
            .then((result) => {
                go.run(result.instance);
            });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

The file is empty. It just loads the `wasm_exec.js` and fetches a `main.wasm`
file, which we will create later from our code.

### Compile your code into `main.wasm`

Let's create a super-simple Go program in the `./main-wasm/main.go` path of
your project:

```go
package main

import "log"

func main() {
	log.Println("Hello Gophers!")
}
```

And let's compile it into the `./site/main.wasm` binary file:

```
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ./site/main.wasm ./wasm-main/.
```

### Execute your Go WebAssembly program

You will need a Web server to allow fetching all the information. Modern IDEs
like IntelliJ IDEA allows just executing your files in a bundled Web server just
by clicking the Browser icons on the top-right corner of your HTML code:

If you are using a plain text editor and don't want to install any web server,
you can just create the following `server.go` file in your root directory:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)
// super-simple debug server to test our Go WASM files
func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
		if req.RequestURI == "/" {
			req.RequestURI = "/index.html"
		}
		file, err := os.Open(filepath.Join("./site", req.RequestURI))
		if err == nil {
			io.Copy(w, file)
		}
	})
	fmt.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

So when you run the server (e.g. `go run server.go`) and open the
`http://localhost:8080` in your browser, you should see an empty screen, but if
you open the _Console_ in the _developer tools_ section of your browser,
you should see that the `log` command in the `./main-wasm/main.go` has been
executed:

To allow Go interacting with a Web Page, let's see some methods of the `syscall/js`
library.

## `syscall/js` basic functionalities

Let's walk through the basic functionalities of `syscall/js` with a simple
example:





### `js.Global()`: getting the global object

This function returns the JavaScript global object, usually the equivalent
to the JavaScript `window` object: the _root_ object that will allow you accessing
all the other elements in your page.

The returned type is a `js.Value`. This struct can store any JavaScript type.
You will get used to work with `js.Value`, as it's what most functions and
properties return.

### `js.Value{}.Get(...)`: accessing the property of any value
