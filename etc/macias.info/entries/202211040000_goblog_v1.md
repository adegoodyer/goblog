# The engine behind this blog reached version 1.0

In 2017, started to code the [engine that runs this blog](https://github.com/mariomac/goblog) as
a learning exercise for the Go programming language, following the famous
[Writing Web Applications](https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/) official tutorial.
That means that the quality of some parts of the code of this blog was poor, making it
difficult to understand (even for myself) and difficult to extend with new,
useful features that I had in mind to agilize even more my writing/publishing
workflows.

Last summer I worked in a version 1.0 and, after running stable for 4 months,
I'm releasing it today. Version 1.0 improves
modularity and code quality, and also adds some useful features:

* Caching web assets in memory, including the rendered MarkDowns and templates,
  for a lower CPU consumption.
* Assets are reloaded on every change detected on disk (and cache is
  invalidated), so you don't need to restart the `goblog` process/service each
  time you wanted that your changes take effect.

Version 1.0 also includes some minor improvements, like more
detailed logger messages and some new configurable options.

Soon, I will publish a new blog post explaining my new workflow to locally
write and publish my blog posts.
