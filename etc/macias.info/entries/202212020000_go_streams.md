# Performance comparison of Go functional stream libraries

With the arrival of [Generics to Go 1.18](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics), a new programming model has arrived to
Go: functional stream processing. This post evaluates some current
libraries providing such functionality, and compares
the achieved performance in single-thread streams.

## Contenders

The first contender is the [mariomac/gostream](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream)
library, which was created by myself. Since there aren't popular or widely used
stream libraries in Go, we had to Google for a while to find the other alternatives
to compare:

We found some other interesting libraries, but they are not compared here for
diverse reasons:

* [jucardi/go-streams](https://github.com/jucardi/go-streams)
  requires that all the elements in the stream implement the `comparable`
  constraint. The test scenario described in the next section uses maps, which
  do not fulfill that constraint, so it was impossible to implement it with
  this library.
* [reugn/go-streams](https://github.com/reugn/go-streams) looks as a very
  powerful library, but it seems to be more oriented to be connected to external
  services (Kafka, filesystems...) rather than general-purpose in-memory operations.

## Test scenario: anagram finder

To test the performance libraries, whe choose a simple example using a few subset
of operations that is common to all the libraries:
* Convert a slice to a stream
* Filter elements that match a given premise
* Map elements, transforming or converting them to another type
* Reduce the stream into a single object by aggregating all the objects

The scenario receives a slice of words and returns a map with a set of anagrams.
The pseudo-code would be something like:

```
function Anagrams(input: []string)
    Returns :Map<key: set of letters, value: list of anagrams to the key>
{
    return input.ConvertToStream()
                .Filter(MoreThanOneChar)
                .Map(ToLowerCase)
                .Map(SingleWordToMap)
                .Reduce(Accumulate)
}
```

The implementations rely on [some provided functions](https://github.com/mariomac/go-stream-benchmarks/blob/main/anafind/anagram.go):

* `MoreThanOneChar(string) bool` returns true if the input string length is >1.
  This will allow us discarding empty words or words with 1 letter whose anagrams
  are not interesting to us.
* `ToLowerCase(string) string` converts the input string to lower case so we
  avoid words with uppercase to be treated differently as their lowercase
  equivalent.
* `SingleWordToMap` converts a string to a single-map entry where the key is
  an ordered set of the characters of the input word and the value is a 1-lengt
  set with the actual word.
* `Accumulate` merges two anagrams' map into a single map: it adds the keys of
  the source map that are missing in the destination map, and merges the sets
  of the coinciding keys.

## Implementations

The different implementations for the anagrams finder can be completely seen
in the following repository:

https://github.com/mariomac/go-stream-benchmarks

### Baseline implementation

Functional processing might come at a cost, so we also provide an iterative
implementation that would act as "theoretically fastest" implementation and would
give us a better perspective of the performance of the functional approaches.

```go
func Baseline(words []string) map[string]map[string]struct{} {
	var swa []Anagrams
	for _, w := range words {
		if !MoreThanOneChar(w) {
			continue
		}
		swa = append(swa, SingleWordToMap(strings.ToLower(w)))
	}
	if len(swa) == 0 {
		return nil
	}
	seed := swa[0]
	for i := range swa[1:] {
		seed = Accumulate(seed, swa[i])
	}
	return seed
}
```

### [mariomac/gostream](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream)

The [mariomac/gostream](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream) library implements
the above pseudo-code as following:

```go
func Mariomac(words []string) map[string]map[string]struct{} {
	wordStream := stream.OfSlice(words).
		Filter(MoreThanOneChar).
		Map(strings.ToLower)
	groupedWords, _ := stream.Map(wordStream, SingleWordToMap).
		Reduce(Accumulate)
	return groupedWords
}
```

Observe that the above pseudo-code defines the whole stream pipeline in a fluent
style (the result of a method invocation is immediately invoked without storing
it into a variable). However, here we require an intermediate `groupedWords`
variable. The reason is a [limitation in the Go generics' implementation](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49085)
that prevents that a `Map` **method** returns an element with different type of the
argument. So here we need to invoke it as a **function**.

### [primetalk/goio](https://github.com/Primetalk/goio)

[primetalk/goio](https://github.com/Primetalk/goio)  would implement anagram
finder would be implemented as follows:

```go
func Goio(words []string) map[string]map[string]struct{} {
	wordStr := stream.FromSlice(words)
	fWords := stream.Filter(wordStr, MoreThanOneChar)
	lfWords := stream.Map(fWords, strings.ToLower)
	swAgrs := stream.Map(lfWords, SingleWordToMap)
	swAgrsSl := stream.ToSlice(swAgrs)
	swArgsRs, err := io.ObtainResult(io.Continuation[[]Anagrams](swAgrsSl))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	return slice.Reduce(swArgsRs, Accumulate)
}
```

You will notice some subtle changes in the different API design decisions.

### [vladimirvivien/automi](https://github.com/vladimirvivien/automi) 

[vladimirvivien/automi](https://github.com/vladimirvivien/automi) does not
provide yet Generics' support so you will notice that at some point we need to
do a type cast. The API is clean but at the cost of potential runtime errors, since
methods accept unchecked `interface{}` as argument.

```go
func Automi(words []string) map[string]map[string]struct{} {
	var res Anagrams
	str := stream.New(words).
		Filter(MoreThanOneChar).
		Map(strings.ToLower).
		Map(SingleWordToMap).
		Reduce(Anagrams{}, Accumulate).
		Into(collectors.Func(func(i interface{}) error {
			res = i.(Anagrams)
			return nil
		}))
	if err := <-str.Open(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	return res
}
```

### [koss-null/lambda](https://github.com/koss-null/lambda)

And last, but not least, [koss-null/lambda](https://github.com/koss-null/lambda)
is providing an API that is very similar to [mariomac/gostream](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream).

```go
func Lambda(words []string) map[string]map[string]struct{} {
	wordStream := pipe.Slice(words).Parallel(1).
		Filter(MoreThanOneChar).
		Map(strings.ToLower)
	groupedWords := pipe.Map(wordStream, SingleWordToMap).
		Reduce(Accumulate)
	return *groupedWords
}
```

Please notice that we limited the parallelization to 1 single worker, as not all
the contenders implement parallelization, and this blog post compares the
most common single-thread scenario (e.g. willing to keep the order of the
resultant streams).

## Benchmark results

We benchmarked the different implementations with Go 1.19.3 on an
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz running a Mac OS X

## Conclusions

The tests demonstrated that [mariomac/gostream](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream)
is currently the most efficient functional library for functional-like in-memory
stream composition. Both in terms of CPU and memory generation.

It was surprisingly near the baseline implementation. However,
[other dummy micro-benchmarks shown that a functional stream-based pipeline might be several times slower than a proper iterative implementation](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream#performance).

However, other libraries such as [koss-null/lambda](https://github.com/koss-null/lambda)
could beat [mariomac/gostream](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream) if you enable
parallelization, as this feature is not yet available in the later.

I could have missed some features improving the readability or performance of
the rest of contenders, or there could be more stream-processing libraries
around there that would beat any of the implementations of this blog post. In
that case, feel free to leave a comment informing about them and I will do
my best to update the post with the new alternatives and results.

## Update (Dec 5th 2022)

A reader of this article kindly contributed with another library that seems to outperform
_by a smidgen_ the Gostream library, in terms of speed, with similar memory generation:
[github.com/kamstrup/fn](https://github.com/kamstrup/fn).

The API looks slightly different:

```go
func Fn(words []string) map[string]map[string]struct{} {
	wordsLower := fn.ArrayOf(words).
		Where(MoreThanOneChar).
		Shape(strings.ToLower)
	singleWords := fn.MapOf(wordsLower, SingleWordToMap)
	return fn.Into(Anagrams{}, Accumulate, singleWords)
}
```

[In their own words](https://github.com/mariomac/go-stream-benchmarks/pull/1):

> I think the primary difference between our approaches is that you seem closer to Java Streams, and I am a bit closer to Clojure. Fx. my Seq API is designed to work on "immutable sequences", ie you get a head+tail back when you walk a Seq, and the underlying Seq is stateless. Whereas your stream lib keeps a stateful iterator.

Digging into its code, I also see another basic difference, while [mariomac/gostream](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream)
is designed for lazy evaluation of each stream's element, [kamstrup/fn](https://github.com/kamstrup/fn) performs
eager evaluation.
