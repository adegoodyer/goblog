# The engine behind this blog is reaching 1.0 (beta)

I coded the [engine that runs this blog](https://github.com/mariomac/goblog) as
a learning exercise for the Go programming language, following the famous
[Writing Web Applications](https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/) official tutorial.
That means that the quality of the code of this blog is poor, making it
difficult to understand (even for myself) and difficult to extend with new,
useful features that I had in mind to agilize even more my writing/publishing
workflows.

During few days, I've been working on a future version 1.0, which improves
modularity and code quality, and also adds some useful features:

* Caching web assets in memory, including the rendered MarkDowns and templates,
  for a lower CPU consumption.
* Assets are reloaded on every change detected on disk (and cache is
  invalidated), so you don't need to restart the `goblog` process/service each
  time you wanted that your changes take effect.

This future version 1.0 also includes some minor improvements, like more
detailed logger messages and some new configurable options.

Soon, I will publish a new blog post explaining my new workflow to locally
write and publish my blog posts.
